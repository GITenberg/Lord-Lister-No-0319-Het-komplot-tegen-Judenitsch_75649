summary: '"Lord Lister No. 0319: Het komplot tegen Judenitsch" by Kurt Matull et al.
  is a historical fiction novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set
  against the backdrop of the Russian Civil War and follows the character John Raffles,
  who is disguised as Count Finsbury. Aided by his companions Charly Brand and James
  Henderson, Raffles becomes entangled in a dangerous struggle between the Red and
  White factions as they attempt to navigate this treacherous landscape while also
  seeking a kidnapped young woman.  At the start of the narrative, the trio is traveling
  through a snowy plain, facing the harsh elements of winter and the looming conflict
  in Russia. Raffles and his friends are motivated by the need to rescue Ilja Sicorsky,
  the fianc√©e of their friend, who has been captured by a White officer. As they navigate
  their way through hostile territories and avoid detection, they encounter a patrol
  of White soldiers, leading to a tense standoff where their allegiances come into
  question. The opening establishes a thrilling atmosphere filled with danger and
  deception, setting the stage for the characters'' evolving missions amidst the chaos
  of war. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
